# Final Year Project

This project is focused around  creating a Cloud and/or mobile/tablet-based application to enable the tracking of people within an organisation for a number of purposes. These include monitoring the usage of resources such as offices, meeting rooms, laboratories or lecture theatres. It can also be used for real-time booking or searching for free resources such as rooms or desks, updating their free/used status immediately. Finally, with certain current restrictions on movements and gatherings of people, it can be used to alert to breaches of safety that may be occurring for further investigation or action by staff (e.g. a room is over-crowded, affecting social distancing).
The application may involve use of mobile GPS technology, NFC tags, Beacons, or any other relevant, cutting-edge components (hardware/software) which may be relevant in providing the appropriate monitoring information to the application. Research into these technologies will be required. A User Interface will also be required, to provide graphical/chart-based statistical analysis and reporting for monitoring resource usage, as well as providing an intuitive and visual method of end users viewing resource availability in real-time. The application should also provide graphical views of occupancy for safety monitoring (for example, Red, Amber, Green statuses on graphical floor plans, or appropriate use of Google Maps)
